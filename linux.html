# What is Linux?

* Linux is an operating system that evolved from a kernel created by Linus Torvalds when he was a student at the University of Helsinki.
* It’s meant to be used as an alternative to other operating systems, Windows, Mac OS, MS-DOS, Solaris and others.
* Linux is the most popular OS used in a Supercomputer

| OS Family | Count | Share % |
|:---------:| -----:| -------:|
| Linux | 498 | 99.6 |
| Unix  |   2 |   .4 |

* If you are using a Supercomputer/High Performance Computer for your research, it will be based on a \*nix OS.
* It is required/neccessary/mandatory to learn Linux Programming (commands, shell scripting) if your research involves use of High Performance Computing or Supercomputing resources.


---

# Where is Linux used?

* Linux distributions are tailored to different requirements such as
- Server
- Desktop
- Workstation
- Routers
- Embedded devices
- Mobile devices (Android is a Linux-based OS)
* Almost any software that you use on windows has a roughly equivalent software on Linux, most often multiple equivalent software
- e.g. Microsoft Office equivalents are OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice, KOffice
- [ Visit for complete list ](http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux_software_equivalent_to_Windows_software)
* Linux offers you freedom, to choose your desktop environment, software.


---

# What is a Linux OS and Distro?

* Many software vendors release their own packaged Linux OS (kernel, applications) known as distribution
* Linux distribution = Linux kernel + GNU system utilities and libraries + Installation scripts + Management utilities etc.
- Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
- Red Hat, Fedora, __CentOS__
- Slackware, openSUSE, SLES, SLED
- Gentoo
* Application packages on Linux can be installed from source or from customized packages
- deb: Debian based distros e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
- rpm: Red Hat based distros, Slackware based distros.


---

# What is a Desktop Environment?


* Linux distributions offer a variety of desktop environment.
- K Desktop Environment (KDE)
- GNOME
- __XFCE__
- Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment (LXDE)
- Cinnamon
- __MATE__
- Dynamic Window Manager


---

# Shell versus Command

* What is a Shell?
  - The command line interface is the primary interface to Linux/Unix operating
systems.
  - Shells are how command-line interfaces are implemented in Linux/Unix.
  - Each shell has varying capabilities and features and the user should choose the shell that best suits their needs.
  - The shell is simply an application running on top of the kernel and provides a powerful interface to the system.
* What is a command and how do you use it?
  - __command__ is a directive to a computer program acting as an interpreter of some kind,
in order to perform a specific task.
  - __command prompt__ (or just __prompt__) is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands.
  - Its intent is to literally prompt the user to take action.
  - A prompt usually ends with one of the characters $, %, #, :, &gt; and often includes other information, such as the path of the current working directory.


---

# Types of Shell

* __sh__ : Bourne Shell
  - Developed by Stephen Bourne at AT&amp;T Bell Labs
* __csh__ : C Shell
  - Developed by Bill Joy at University of California, Berkeley
* __ksh__ : Korn Shell
  - Developed by David Korn at AT&amp;T Bell Labs
  - backward-compatible with the Bourne shell and includes many features of the C shell
* __bash__ : Bourne Again Shell
  - Developed by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell (sh).
  - Default Shell on Linux and Mac OSX
* __tcsh__ : TENEX C Shell
  - Developed by Ken Greer at Carnegie Mellon University
  - It is essentially the C shell with programmable command line completion, command-line editing, and a few other features.

# File System Hierarchy


---


# Directory Structure

* All files are arranged in a hierarchial structure, like an inverted tree.
*  The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called __root__ (written as a slash / )

![scale: 90%](../lurc/assets/img/LinuxFS.png)


---

# Relative &amp; Absolute Path

* Path means a position in the directory tree.
* You can use either the relative path or absolute path
* In relative path expression
-  . (one dot or period) is the current working directory
-  .. (two dots or periods) is one directory up
-  You can combine . and .. to navigate the filee system hierarchy.
-  the path is not defined uniquely and does depend on the current path.
-  ../../tmp is unique only if your current working directory is your home directory.
* In absolute path expression
-  the path is defined uniquely and does not depend on the current path
-  /tmp is unique since /tmp is the abolute path

# Commands


---
# Commands

* `man` shows the manual for a command or program.
  - `man pwd`
* `pwd`: print working directory, gives the absolute path of your current location in the directory hierarchy
* `echo`: prints whatever follows to the screen
  - `echo $HOME`: prints the contents of the variable __HOME__ i.e. your home directory to the screen
* `cd dirname`: change to folder called `dirname`
  - default `dirname` is your home directory
  - Useful option 
    - `cd -` go to previous directory
* `mkdir dirname`: create a directory called `dirname`
  - Create a directory, any name you want and cd to that directory 
  - `mkdir me450` followed by `cd me450`
  - Useful option
    - `mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3` create intermediate directories if they do not exist


---

# Commands (contd)

* `cp file1 file2`: command to copy file1 to file2
  - `cp -r /home/alp514/Workshop/sum2017 .` copy directories recursively
  - `cp -p ~alp514/in.lj ~/` preserve time stamps
* `rm file1`: delete a file called file1 
  - `rm -i` to be prompted for confirmation
  - `rm -r` to delete directories recursively 
  - `rm -f` delete without prompting - VERY DANGEROUS
* `ls dirname`: list contents of _dirname_ (leave blank for current directory)
  - `ls -l` show long form listing
  - `ls -a` show hidden files
  - `ls -t` sort by timestamp newest first, best when combined with `-l`
  - `ls -r` reverse sort (default alphabetical), best when combined with `-l -t` or `-lt`
* `alias`: create a shortcut to another command or name to execute a long string.
  - `alias rm="/bin/rm -i"`


---

# Commands (contd)

* To display a file to screen, \*nix provides three commands at your disposal
  *  `cat` : Show contents of a file.
  * `more`  : Display contents one page at a time.
  * `less` : Display contents one page at a time but allow forward/backward scrolling

* Usage: `&lt;command&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;filename&gt;`
* Example: `cat .bashrc`

* To scroll forward in `more` or `less`, use the space bar, `CNTRL-f/d` or \"Page Down\" key.
* To scroll backwards in `less` use `CNTRL-b/u` or \"Page Up\".
* To quit from `more` or `less`, use `q`
* A rarely used command, `tac` does the opposite of `cat` i.e. show contents of a file in reverse.


---

  - `touch file.dat`
* `ln`: Link a file to another file aka create shortcuts.
  - `ln -s`: create symbolic link, can span filesystems.
  - `ln`: create hardline within same filesystem.
  - you can create symbolic link to a directory, hardlinks to files only.
* `head`/`tail`: Display first/last few lines of a file.
* `head .bashrc`
  * By default, 10 lines are displayed.
  * `tail -n 20 .bashrc`: display last 20 lines.

# Commands (contd)

* `!name`: rerun previously executed command with the same arguments as before, `name &lt;args&gt;`.
  * Note that you do not always have to type the full command `name`, just the minimum unique characters (no spaces) of `name` need to be entered.
  * If you had entered two commands `name &lt;args&gt;` and `nbme &lt;args&gt;`, then to rerun `name`, use the command `!na`.
* `history`: display a list of last executed commands. Optional argument will list the last m commands.
  * All previously executed commands will be listed with a number `n`.
  * To rerun a command from history which has number `n`, run the command `!n`


---

# Filename Completion

-  Filename or Tab completion is a default feature in `bash` and `tcsh`.
- It allows to a user to automatically complete the file, directory or command name you are typing upto the next unique characters using the &amp;#8633; key.
- Example: Your home directory contains directories `Desktop`, `Documents` and `Downloads`.
- If you enter the command `ls D` &amp;#8863; you will be prompted with above the three directory names.

---

# Wildcards

-   \*nix shells have the ability to refer to more than one file by name using special characters called Wildcards.
-   Wildcards can be used with \*nix utilities such as ls, cp, mv, rm, tar and g(un)zip.
* `?`:  match a single character 
* `*`:  match zero or more characters 
* `[abc]`:  match list of characters in the list specified
*  `[!abc]` : match characters not in the list specified

---

# Login to remote systems

* Most Linux/UNIX systems allow secure shell connections from other systems.
* Usage: `ssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;host&gt;`
* Example: `ssh alp514@ssh.cc.lehigh.edu`

&lt;script id="asciicast-m8nL11w1ax7lPVUTr9v2vispM" src="http://asciinema.org/a/m8nL11w1ax7lPVUTr9v2vispM.js" async data-rows=35&gt;&lt;/script&gt;



---

# Transferring Files

- `scp` is a command to copy files/directories between two \*nix hosts over the SSH protocol.
- Usage: `scp &lt;options&gt; &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:/path/to/source/file &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:/path/to/destination/file/or/directory`
- Common options
  - `-r` copy directories recursively
  - `-p` preserve time stamps

&lt;script id="asciicast-b6xwnNELhI7SNoFpi0sIFslx2" src="http://asciinema.org/a/b6xwnNELhI7SNoFpi0sIFslx2.js" async data-rows=35&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


---

# Transferring Files

* `rsync` is another utility that can be used to copy files locally and remotely.
* Usage: `rsync &lt;option&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;`
* It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm 
  - i.e. sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination.
* Rsync is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.
* Common options:
  * `-a`:  archive mode
  * `-r`:  recurse into directories
  * `-v`:  increase verbosity
  * `-z`:  compress file data during the transfer
  * `-u`:  skip files that are newer on the receiver
  * `-t`:  preserve modification times
  * `-n`:  dry-run, perform a trial run with no changes made
* Example: `rsync -avtzu sol.cc.lehigh.edu:∼/* .`


---

# Compressing and Archiving

* Quite often you need to compress and uncompress files to reduce storage usage or bandwidth while transferring files.
* \*nix systems have built-in utilities to compress/uncompress files
* Compress: `gzip`, `zip`, `bzip2` 
* Uncompress: `gunzip`, `unzip`, `bunzip2` 
* Gzipped files have an extension `.gz`,`.z` or `.Z`
* zipped files have an extension `.Zip` or `.zip`
* Bzipped files have an extension `.bz2` , `.bz`

&lt;script id="asciicast-mEPHge0EgcmWPEzRxFakNrNTf" src="https://asciinema.org/a/mEPHge0EgcmWPEzRxFakNrNTf.js" async data-autoplay="true" data-rows=10&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

---

# Tar

* \*nix provides the `tar` package to create and manipulate streaming archive of files.
* Usage: `tar &lt;options&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;patterns&gt;`
  - `file` is the name of the tar archive file, usually with extension `.tar`
  - `patterns` are pathnames for files/directories being archived
* Common options
  - `-c`:  create an archive file
  - `-x`:  extract to disk from archive
  - `-t`:  list contents of archive
  - `-z/-j`:  filter the archive through gzip/bzip2 (adds/requires extension .gz/bz2)
  - `-v`:  verbosely list files processed
  - `-f`:  read the archive from or write the archive to the specified file
* Example:  `tar -cvzf myhome.tar.gz ${HOME}/*`
* This becomes useful for creating a backup of your files and directories that you can store at some storage facility e.g.  external disk

---

# File Editing

* The two most commonly used editors on Linux/Unix systems are:
  -  `vi` or `vim` (vi improved)
  -  `emacs`
* `vi/vim` is installed by default on Linux/Unix systems and has only a command line interface (CLI).
* `emacs` has both a CLI and a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Other editors that you may come across on \*nix systems
  - `kate`: default editor for KDE.
  - `gedit`: default text editor for GNOME desktop environment.
  - `gvim`: GUI version of vim
  - `pico`: console based plain text editor
  - `nano`: GNU.org clone of pico
  - `kwrite`: editor by KDE.

---

# vi/emacs commands

* `vi/vim` and `emacs` are the two most popular \*nix file editors.
* Which one to use is up to you.
* `vi/vim` has two modes
  * Editing mode
  * Command mode
* `emacs` has only one mode as in any editor that you use.

# I/O Redirection

* There are three file descriptors for I/O streams
  - __STDIN__: Standard Input
  - __STDOUT__: Standard Output
  - __STDERR__: Standard Error
* 1 represents STDOUT and 2 represents STDERR
* I/O redirection allows users to connect applications
  - `&lt;`: connects a file to STDIN of an application
  - `&gt;`: connects STDOUT of an application to a file
  - `&gt;&gt;`: connects STDOUT of an application by appending to a file
  - `|`:  connects the STDOUT of an application to STDIN of another application.

# File Permissions

- Since \*NIX OS’s are designed for multi user environment, it is necessary to restrict access of files to other users on the system.
- In \*NIX OS’s, you have three types of file permissions
   1. read (r)
   2. write (w)
   3. execute (x)
- for three types of users
   1. user (u)
   2. group (g)
   3. world (o) i.e.  everyone else who has access to the system



---

# File Permissions (contd)

&lt;script id="asciicast-uqai4femuaYOAoZjReXNI5qwv" src="https://asciinema.org/a/uqai4femuaYOAoZjReXNI5qwv.js" async data-autoplay="true" data-rows=16&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

* The first character signifies the type of the file
  - _d_ for directory
  - _l_ for symbolic link
  - _-_ for normal file
* The next three characters of first triad signifies what the owner can do
* The second triad signifies what group member can do
* The third triad signifies what everyone else can do


---

# File Permissions (contd)

* Read carries a weight of 4
* Write carries a weight of 2
* Execute carries a weight of 1
* The weights are added to give a value of 7 (rwx) , 6(rw), 5(rx) or 3(wx) permissions.
* `chmod` is a \*NIX command to change permissions on a file.
* Usage: `chmod &lt;option&gt; &lt;permissions&gt; &lt;file or directory name&gt;`
* To give user rwx, group rx and world x permission, the command is
  - `chmod 751 filename`
* Instead of using numerical permissions you can also use symbolic mode
  - __u/g/o__ or __a__: for user/group/world or all i.e.  __ugo__ 
  - __+/-__:  Add/remove
  - __r/w/x__  read/write/execute permission
* Give everyone execute permission:
  - `chmod a+x hello.sh` or `chmod ugo+x hello.sh`
* Remove group and world read &amp; write permission:
  - `chmod go-rw hello.sh`


---

# Process Management

* A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID
* `ps`: To see information about your running processes and their PID and status.
  * By default `ps` only shows processes in the current shell.
  * `ps a` or `ps -e` shows all running processes
* A process may be in foreground, background or be suspended.
  * `program`: Start a program in foreground.
  * `program &amp;`: Start program and run in background. 
  * `CTRL-z`: Suspend an application running in the foreground.
  * `fg`: continue running the suspended application in the foreground.
  * `bg`: continue running the suspended application in the background.
* `jobs`: show list of backgrounded processes in the current shell.
  * `fg %jobnumber`: put process listed as _jobnumber_ from `jobs` command in foreground. 
  * `bg %jobnumber`: put process listed as _jobnumber_ from `jobs` command in background.

---

# Process Management (contd)

* `CTRL-c`: kill a foregrounded process.
* Killing backgrounded process in current shell
  * `kill %jobnumber`: where _jobnumber_ is the backgrounded process from `jobs` commands
* To Kill or Terminate a process
  * First use `ps a` or `ps -e` to get PID
  * `kill pid`: job process with PID _pid_
* The `kill` command can take options specific to UNIX signals
* The most common option is `-9` for the `SIGKILL` signal
* `pstree`:  display a tree of processes
* `pkill`:  kill process by its name, user name, group name, terminal, UID, EUID, and GID.

# Environment Variables


---

# Environment Variables

* \*nix permits the use of variables, similar to any programming.
* A variable is a named object that contains data used by one or more applications.
* There are two types of variables, __Environment__ and __User Defined__.
* __Environment Variables__ provides a simple way to share configuration settings between multiple applications and processes in Linux.
* By Convention, enviromental variables are often named using all uppercase letters
  * e.g. `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_INCLUDE_PATH`, `TEXINPUTS`, etc
* To reference a variable (environment or user defined) prepend `$` to the name of thevariable
  * e.g. `$PATH`, `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
* `printenv`: list the current environmental variables.
* `env` print a list of environment variables or run another utility in an altered environment without having to modify the currently existing environment.
  - `env SHELL=/bin/tcsh xterm`: start an xterm session in __tcsh__


---

# Frequently used Environment Variables 

* __PATH__:  colon-separated list of directories to search for commands.
* __HOME__:  indicate where a user’s home directory is located in the file system.
* __PWD__:  contains path to current working directory.
* __OLDPWD__:  contains path to previous working directory.
* __TERM__:  specifies the type of computer terminal or terminal emulator being used.
* __SHELL__:  contains name of the running, interactive shell.
* __PS1__:  default command prompt.
* __PS2__:  secondary command prompt
* __LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH__:  colon-separated set of directories where libraries should be searched for first.
* __HOSTNAME__:  The system host name.
* __USER__:  Current logged in user’s name
* __DISPLAY__:  Network name of the X11 display to connect to, if available.

* You can edit the environment variables.
* Command to do this depends on the shell
* To add your bin directory to the __PATH__ variable in 
   * __sh/ksh/bash__: `export PATH=${HOME}/bin:${PATH}`
   * __csh/tcsh__: `setenv PATH` `$HOME/bin:$PATH`
* Note the syntax for the above commands
   * __sh/ksh/bash__: no spaces except between `export` and `PATH`
   * __csh,tcsh__: no `=` sign, just a space between `PATH` and the absolute path 
   * __all shells__: colon(`:`)  to separate different paths and the variable that is appended to.
* __Yes, the order matters__. 
   * Suppose you have a customized version of a software say `perl` in your home directory, 
      * if you append the perl path to __PATH__ at the end, your program will use the system wide perl not your locally installed version.
      * to use your version of perl, you need to prepend __PATH__

# User Defined Variables


* Rules for Variable Names
  - Variable names must start with a letter or underscore
  - Number can be used anywhere else
  - DO NOT USE special characters such as @, #, %, $
  - Case sensitive
  - Examples
      - __Allowed__:  VARIABLE, VAR1234able, varname,VAR
      - __Not Allowed__:  1VARIABLE, %NAME, $myvar, VAR@NAME
* Assigning value to a variable

| Type | sh,ksh,bash | csh,tcsh | 
|:----:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| Shell | `name=value` | `set name = value` |
| Environment | `export name=value` | `setenv name value` |

# Start Up scripts

* When you login to a \*NIX computer, shell scripts are automatically loaded depending on your default shell
* __sh,ksh__
   * /etc/profile
   * $HOME/.profile
* __bash__
   * /etc/profile, login terminal only
   * /etc/bashrc or /etc/bash/bashrc
   * $HOME/.bash_profile, login terminal only
   * $HOME/.bashrc
* __csh,tcsh__ 
   * /etc/csh.cshrc
   * $HOME/.tcshrc
   * $HOME/.cshrc if .tcshrc is not present
* The .bashrc, .tcshrc, .cshrc, .bash\_profile are script files where users can define their own aliases, environment variables, modify paths etc.
   * e.g.  the `alias` command covered earlier
